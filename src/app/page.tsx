      "Custom software, websites, Shopify and WooCommerce, mobile apps, POS, CRM/ERP, SEO and digital marketing. Practical AI is available when a product needs it. Every service has its own page on /services.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with international clients?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We are based in Pakistan and work remotely with clients across the UK, US, UAE, Australia and Canada. Projects run with scheduled overlap hours, shared boards and weekly demo calls so time zones never become a bottleneck.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do projects usually start?",
    answer:
      "With a short discovery conversation. We clarify goals, constraints and budget, then send a written scope with milestones, deliverables and a timeline. Development only begins once that document is agreed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do we own the code and accounts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Source code, repositories, hosting, domains and analytics accounts are yours. We deliver into your own accounts wherever possible so there is never a dependency on us to keep operating.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Every project includes a post-launch stabilisation window. After that, monthly support and maintenance plans cover updates, monitoring, security patching, and an agreed allowance for enhancements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you improve an existing website or app?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. We start with an audit of the current codebase, performance and analytics, then recommend targeted improvements or a phased rebuild — whichever gives better value for your situation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you publish client testimonials?",
    answer:
      "Named reviews and confidential screens go public only with written permission. Until then, inspect live demo websites, the project profiles on the portfolio, and ask for a private reference from the contact page. We do not invent testimonials, client logos or results.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a project cost?",
    answer:
      "It depends on pages, modules and integrations. A small first phase can be modest; a POS or marketplace is not. Exact price is a written plan after discovery — not a public sticker. How we quote is on the WordbitX software development cost page.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is WordbitX hiring?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Software jobs in Pakistan are listed on the WordbitX careers page and opened the week of 15 September 2026. Apply with work you have shipped.",

          Solutions and Industries overlapped on four entries (real estate,
          healthcare, education, e-commerce) while sitting six sections
          apart. One section, two sub-blocks.

          Sub-block order is sector tiles first, platform cards second, and
          that order is load-bearing:
           - The section heading promises industries ("the industries we
             already understand") and its description is pure sector language
             — plot files, batch and expiry, jewellery pricing, fee vouchers.
             Opening with six platform cards answered a question the heading
             had not asked, and pushed the tiles 2,042px below their own H2.
           - Funnel order is broad then narrow: thirteen sectors ("is my
             business here?") before the platform we would actually hand you.
           - The tiles are dark photography, so leading with them gives this
             light section a visual opening even though #portfolio below it
             is also light. That is why neither section needed a tone change.

          Position: moved ahead of #portfolio so the flow reads
          capability → fit → proof; it still sits above #reviews, which
          matters because sector fit is a higher-intent question than
          social proof. */}
