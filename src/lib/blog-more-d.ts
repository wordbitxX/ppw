/**
 * Price and cost guides.
 *
 * These are the highest-intent informational queries we were not covering.
 * Somebody searching "pos software price in pakistan" is shopping, not
 * browsing — and until now the site answered that query nowhere.
 *
 * Two rules for anything added to this file:
 *
 * 1. The numbers are MARKET ranges observed in Pakistan, not a WordbitX rate
 *    card. /pricing deliberately publishes no sticker price ("quoted on the
 *    brief"), and these posts must not quietly contradict it. Say plainly
 *    that the figures are what the market charges and that our own number
 *    comes from a scoped brief.
 * 2. No invented precision. Ranges, stated as ranges, with the drivers that
 *    move a project from one end to the other. A fake-exact figure is the
 *    fastest way to lose a reader who has already collected three quotes.
 *
 * Images are local files under /public/brand/services so nothing depends on a
 * remote photo host at render time.
 */

/**
 * Price and compliance guides carry a named byline rather than the generic
 * editorial one. These pages quote statutory thresholds and penalty figures,
 * which puts them in Google's YMYL bracket where unattributed content is
 * explicitly rated down — and, more to the point, a buyer deciding whether to
 * trust a cost range deserves to know who stood behind it.
 *
 * Note what this bio does NOT claim: no tax credential, no accountancy
 * qualification, no licensed-integrator status. The expertise asserted is
 * building the software, which is true and checkable. Inventing a CPA to
 * satisfy an SEO checklist would be the same unverifiable-claim problem the
 * audit already flagged on team photos and testimonials.
