/**
 * Sector rail — the first thing under the hero.
 *
 * Why it exists: "do you understand *my* business?" is the question every
 * visitor arrives with, and the block that answers it properly (the thirteen
 * industry tiles under "Workflows we have already modelled") sits at screen
 * 11 of a 23-screen page. Even after moving that section up, a buyer who
 * does not see their sector in the first few seconds has no reason to keep
 * scrolling to find it.
 *
 * So the *signal* moves to the top while the *section* stays in the funnel.
 * One scannable line of thirteen sector names, each a real link to its own
 * industry page, placed where it costs nothing: the hero is already dark, so
 * this rail is dark too and reads as the hero's base rather than as a new
 * section. No images, no cards, roughly one line of text.
 *
 * Secondary benefit: the thirteen industry pages are among the highest
 * commercial-intent URLs on the site, and until now their only home-page
 * links were ~10,000px down the document. They are now a few hundred pixels
 * from the top of the DOM.
 *
 * Layout: a free horizontal scroller on phones, with a right-edge fade so it
 * is obviously scrollable, and a wrapping row from `sm` up. Deliberately no
 * scroll-snap: mandatory snapping on a row of small pills re-aligns the
 * first chip to the container edge on load and eats the rail's left padding,
 * so the first chip renders flush against the screen edge with its border
 * clipped.
